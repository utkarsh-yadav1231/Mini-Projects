# Dice Roll Simulator

This is a classic "roll the dice" program.   
- We will be using the random module for this,since we want to randomize the numbers we get from the dice.   
- We will import random module in our program.  
- Then we will input the range from (1 -6) to the random function that is the lowest and highest number present on the dice.  
- After that we use a while loop, so that the user can roll the dice again.   
- The roll_again can be set to any value, but here it's set to "yes" or "y", but you can also add other variations to it.
