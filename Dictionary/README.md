# Dictionary Project

This is a classic dictionary program.   
- We will be using the get_close_matches module from difflib in python.  
- We will import raw_data json file in our program.  
- Then we will input the word from user to search and find it in our dictionary(raw_data).  
- After that we call a translate(user defined) function, that will return the meaning of that particular word after finding it.  
- If there is no exact match of the word within our dictionary, then get_close_matches module will be called and it will return the values which looks somewhat similar or close to our word(that was searched earlier).  
- If user finds the his word in the suggested list, then on entering press, the word meaning will be printed. 

> Trivia : The word impossible is not in my dictionary. You can search it. LOL !
