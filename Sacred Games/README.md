# Sacred Games 1.0

**Back Story :**

You all know about Sacred Games real story, but here I had made few changes and will need your help to save Mr. Gaitonde(Our Hero).

You are our Sartaj now. Mr. Gaitonde has called you, to tell you that your city will be bombarded and only you can save the city by diffusing the bomb planted all over the city. But, in this Sacred Games Season 1, we won't let our hero ( Mr. Gaitonde ) die. You can save the world afterwards in Sacred Games Season 2 that will be released soon in this repo.

Now after giving the tip and disconnecting the call with you, Mr. Gaitonde is going to commit suicide, by hanging himself from the cealing fan of his house. Your first mission is to save him ( I know that was not the real story, but added this part just for fun ).

Now, to help you save him, we are giving you a hidden code of his current location, that you have to guess correctly to save Mr. Gaitonde by reaching his place on time before he commits suicide. 

As you start making wrong guesses , you can see him preparing to hang himself. 

GO !! Save our hero ( Mr. Gaitonde ).
